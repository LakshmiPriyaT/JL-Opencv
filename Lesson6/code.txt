import os: Imports the os module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system.

import cv2: Imports the OpenCV library, which is used for image and video processing.

from PIL import Image: Imports the Image class from the PIL (Pillow) library, which is used for image processing.

def resize_images(path):: Defines a function resize_images that takes a path argument. This function will resize all images in the specified directory.

mean_height = 0: Initializes the mean_height variable to 0, which will be used to calculate the average height of images.

mean_width = 0: Initializes the mean_width variable to 0, which will be used to calculate the average width of images.

num_of_images = 0: Initializes the num_of_images variable to 0, which will be used to count the number of images.

for file in os.listdir(path):: Iterates over all files in the specified directory.

if file.endswith('.jpg') or file.endswith('.jpeg') or file.endswith('.png'):: Checks if the file is an image file (JPEG or PNG).

img = Image.open(os.path.join(path, file)): Opens the image file using the Image.open method from Pillow.

width, height = img.size: Gets the width and height of the image.

mean_width += width: Adds the width of the current image to the mean_width variable.

mean_height += height: Adds the height of the current image to the mean_height variable.

num_of_images += 1: Increments the num_of_images variable to count the current image.

mean_width //= num_of_images: Calculates the average width by dividing the total width by the number of images.

mean_height //= num_of_images: Calculates the average height by dividing the total height by the number of images.

for file in os.listdir(path):: Iterates over all files in the specified directory again.

if file.endswith('.jpg') or file.endswith('.jpeg') or file.endswith('.png'):: Checks if the file is an image file (JPEG or PNG).

img = Image.open(os.path.join(path, file)): Opens the image file using the Image.open method from Pillow.

img_resized = img.resize((mean_width, mean_height), Image.ANTIALIAS): Resizes the image to the average width and height calculated earlier using the resize method from Pillow.

img_resized.save(os.path.join(path, file), 'JPEG', quality=95): Saves the resized image to the same path with the same filename, overwriting the original file. The image is saved in JPEG format with a quality of 95.

print(file, " is resized"): Prints a message indicating that the image has been resized.

def video_generator(path):: Defines a function video_generator that takes a path argument. This function will generate a video from images in the specified directory.

video_name = "MyFirstVideo.avi": Specifies the name of the video file to be created.

images = [img for img in os.listdir(path) if img.lower().endswith(('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'))]: Creates a list of image files in the specified directory.

if not images:: Checks if the list of images is empty.

print("No images found in the directory."): Prints a message if no images are found.

return: Exits the function if no images are found.

frame = cv2.imread(os.path.join(path, images[0])): Reads the first image file to get its dimensions.

height, width, _ = frame.shape: Gets the height and width of the first image.

video = cv2.VideoWriter(video_name, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX'), 1, (width, height)): Creates a VideoWriter object to write the video. It specifies the video file name, codec (DIVX), frame rate (1 frame per second), and frame size (width and height of the images).

for image in images:: Iterates over all image files in the list.

video.write(cv2.imread(os.path.join(path, image))): Reads each image file and writes it to the video.

cv2.destroyAllWindows(): Closes all OpenCV windows.

video.release(): Releases the VideoWriter object, saving the video file.

The path variable should be set to the directory where your images are located. You can then call the resize_images function to resize the images and the video_generator function to generate a video from the resized images.
